# Goals

The goal of this lab was to apply the Euler Method to a problem with 2D projectile air resistance. The code for this situation was more complex than that of the radioactive decay.

```python
x[i] = x[i-1] + vx[i-1]*dt
vx[i] = vx[i-1] + ax(input_parameters)*dt

y[i] = y[i-1] + vy[i-1]*dt
vy[i] = vy[i-1] + ay(input_parameters)*dt
```

# Projectile Motion

In this section, we were able to use our known values to solve for the initial velocity in the x and y direction. Our initial conditions were:

```python
m = 10 #mass of a cannon ball (kg)
r = 0.1 #radius of cannon ball
g = 9.8 #acceleration

theta0_deg = 30 #degrees
theta0 = np.radians(theta0_deg) #the conversion of degrees to radians

y0 = 100 #meters
x0 = 0 #meters
v0= 150 #m/s

dt = 0.1
```
To determine our initial velocity in the x and y directions, we used sine and cosine to determine each vector and saved them to their corresponding variables:
```python
v0x = v0*np.cos(theta0)
v0y = v0*np.sin(theta0)
```

### Air Resistance

The goal of this section was to calculate the coefficient of air resistance ($B_2$) for the cannonball using:

### $F_d = C \rho Av^2 = B_2v^2$

We then took the value we collected for $B_2$, and then used it as an input to our acceleration functions that we defined as:

```python
def accel_y(v,B2,m):
  g = 9.8
  if v < 0:
    a = -g + B2/m*v**2
  else:
    a = -g - B2/m*v**2
  return a

def accel_x(v,B2):
  if v < 0:
    a = B2*v**2
  else:
    a = -B2*v**2
  return a
```

Because of the effect of air resistance, we cannot use our estimate of tmax because it may be inaccurate. We must use the append function to loop items to the end of the list after each value is updated.

```python
def calculate(x0,y0,v0x,v0y,B2,m,dt):
  """Calculate the air resistance"""
  vx = [v0x]
  vy = [v0y]
  x = [x0]
  y = [y0]
  t = [0]
  i = 1

  while y[i-1] >= 0:
    y.append(y[i-1]+ vy[i-1]*dt)
    x.append(x[i-1] + vx[i-1]*dt)
    vy.append(vy[i-1] + accel_y(vy[i-1],B2,m)*dt)
    vx.append(vx[i-1] + accel_x(vx[i-1],B2)*dt)
    t.append(t[i-1]+dt)
    i = i+1

  return t, x, y, vx, vy
```
