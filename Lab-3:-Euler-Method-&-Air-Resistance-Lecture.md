# Background

## Ordinary Differential Equation
An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is an equation that relates a function with one variable to its derivatives with respect to the variable that is present up to a certain order within the equation. This equation describes how the function will change over time.

## Taylor Expansion
The Taylor expansion is an approximation of a function near a given point by an infinite sum of terms of its derivatives. The general form is, where f(x) is the function and "a" is the point:
$f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f"(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-a)^2 ...$
